ARMA 2 is the second full ARMA game, released for Microsoft Windows and released in June 2009 using the Real Virtuality game engine. The mod DayZ was released on this title, which requires the other standalone game title Operation Arrowhead. To begin, I would like to state that I have taken part in many Beta tests (closed, under NDA), and have spent thousands of hours at some point in my life developing games as a character texture artist (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSpf471-LOE) and 3d weapon artist (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B5a_xvgvIoSFP4FJGYSE4fuhjJBBwbTN).

Despite the entire gaming industry being in a rough patch since 2015, 2018 still managed to impress me with the amount of bad things that happened. Between Bethesda's mishandling of Fallout 76, Blizzards “don’t you guys have phones” stunt, and EA marketing Battlefield 5 terribly, it’s a miracle that anything good came out this year at all. It’s because of those things that I spent most of my year replaying old games instead of buying new ones. This year, I added.

Delta Force can be argued as the father of Arma and Ghost Recon. This is one of the first tactical shooters that came out at the same time as the first Rainbow Six. Basically, if you move around the gigantic open world and do multiple objectives within the same map with other friendly AIs and you kill and die by one shot, Delta Force did it first. I only played Delta Force: Black Hawk Down (2003) when I was young, which tried to chase the popularity of the film and more linear and casual Medal. Greetings, Redditors. How are you today? Are you good? I hope you're good. Doin' well. Enjoying your holidays. I've got a story for you. Consider it a parable. Let's back up a bit, to start.

This thread is not about bashing the game, I have well over 1000 hours and simply want the best for this game. It is pretty much the only game I play so I am passionate about it and the direction it needs to go to continue to succeed. I want this thread to be about discussion and good ideas to help the game, not bashing it. However, I will be stern/brutally honest on some things. Do not mistake this for bashing/negativity.
