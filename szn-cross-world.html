Man oh man. A complete mess as far as I'm concerned on my server. People visiting from other server just snipping everything and anything they can get their hands on without waiting for people. As title says, we've been trying to queue for uwu for half an hour now with no success. Is anyone else getting a hard time doing content. hewwo this is my first thwead so pwease go easy on me gtwlt!! to get to the point, i am vewy angerwy that wandewers can go to other serwers and partake in hunts. i will not name names because i dont wanna get into twouble by the gweat ToS btw but there's a specific ERPer who instantly pulls all hunts and tries to ERP with them, and he is now on my serwer and instantly pulling things like it has never, ever, happened before!!!! my home serwer has always had a really nice hunt train becaus. Preety much the question in the title. I have used ninban map in emotracker so far. amp#x200B; I tried doing a cross-randomizer run a while ago and it was actually fun up until the point where I forgot to save before closing emotracker and a big chunk of the annotations I made during the last play session vanished. amp#x200B; I gave up half way through mapping the entrances again as in order to reach one of the temples I had to go in and out from kakariko to desert palace, paradox. Like is there a discord for it or is there just cross-world linkshells Looking to join in some cross world ixion (only) hunting linkshells for aether data center. Is this there currently one? I’ll 
As the title said, yesterday i found out that there are groups that are making LSs or Discords server to announce Hunt trains from different Worlds. I found that idea pretty cool but im not sure if there is a LS or a Discord server that is organizing it. If anyone has a any information of where i can find or how i can join one of those server will be appreciated. If this gets a lot of anserws i will edit this with the links or quote the information for everyone else. amp#x200B; EDIT:. I accidentally teleported to China yesterday when trying to TP somewhere in California. Obviously I didn’t interact with anything and quickly TPd where I intended, but I want to know for future reference if I need to wait a full day’s cooldown from the TP from China to America if I don’t interact with the game server. “I prefer Jack Reacher.” Salmond swallowed the last drops of water” “On we go.
